# The Operation group of the twelve tone rows

We are interested in the group $G$ whose elements are all possible combinations of the operations Transposition, Inversion, Retrograde.

The group $G$ can be characterized as being the smallest group generated by elements $T,I,R$ fulfilling the following relations

$$
T^{12} = e, I^2 = e, R^2 = e, TI = IT^{-1}, RT = TR
$$

one immediately sees that it contains the dihedral group with 24 elements as a subgroup.
